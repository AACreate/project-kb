This repository contains both a tool and vulnerability data . Additionally, the MSR2019 folder contains the package associated with the paper we published at the Mining Software Repository conference in 2019 (see below). Why this project \u00b6 In order to feed Eclipse Steady with fresh data, we have spent a considerable amount of time, in the past few years, mining and curating a knowledge base of vulnerabilities that affect open-source components. We know that other parties have been doing the same, in academia as well as in the industry. From this experience, we have learnt that with the growing size of open source ecosystems and the pace at which new vulnerabilities are discovered, the old approach cannot scale. We are also more and more convinced that vulnerability knowledge-bases about open-source should be open-source themselves and adopt the same community-oriented model that governs the rest of the open-source ecosystem. These considerations have pushed us to release our vulnerability knowledge base in early 2019. In June 2020, we made a further step releasing tool support to make the creation, aggregation, and consumption of vulnerability data much easier. We hope this will encourage more contributors to join our efforts to build a collaborative, comprehensive knowledge base where each party remains in control of the data they produce and of how they aggregate and consume data from the other sources. What can project \"KB\" be used for, in practice \u00b6 (work in progress) Project \"KB\" consists essentially of two things: a tool and a knowledge base. The tool ( kaybee ) allows users to do the following: create vulnerability statements; a vulnerability statement is a plain-text file in yaml format that contains data about a given vulnerability, such as the commits that provide a fix for it, a set of notes and references to related Web pages, a list of open-source components that are directly affected by the vulnerability at hand, and so on. fetch vulnerability statements from one or more remote sources (git repositories) merge the content of multiple sources of statements, based on a conflict resolution policy export the result of the merge operation to a variety of different formats The knowledge base , offers a set of vulnerability statements that can be consumed using the kaybee tool. Getting started \u00b6 Installing the kaybee tool \u00b6 There is nothing to install actually, just download a binary compatible with your operating system, make sure it has execution permissions if applicable, and then run it. Optionally, for your convenience, you may want to make sure that the binary is in your $PATH . For example, in Linux you would put the following line in your .bashrc file: export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/kaybee (please, make sure you adjust the path to the kaybee binary as necessary) Alternatively, you can clone this repository and build it yourself (you will need go and make ). You can do so with the make command; inspecting the Makefile first is a good idea. Usage \u00b6 Once you have downloaded or built the binary, you can see the list of supported commands with: kaybee --help Documentation \u00b6 Coming soon. Importing vulnerability data in Eclipse Steady \u00b6 The steps that are required to import the knowledge base in Eclipse Steady are described in this tutorial . Further information can be found here . Publications \u00b6 In early 2019, a snapshot of the knowlege base from project \"KB\" was described in: Serena E. Ponta, Henrik Plate, Antonino Sabetta, Michele Bezzi, C\u00e9dric Dangremont, A Manually-Curated Dataset of Fixes to Vulnerabilities of Open-Source Software , MSR, 2019 If you use the dataset for your research work, please cite it as: @inproceedings{ponta2019msr, author={Serena E. Ponta and Henrik Plate and Antonino Sabetta and Michele Bezzi and C\u00b4edric Dangremont}, title={A Manually-Curated Dataset of Fixes to Vulnerabilities of Open-Source Software}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories}, year=2019, month=May, } MSR 2019 DATA SHOWCASE SUBMISSION : please find here the data and the scripts described in that paper Credits \u00b6 Note that 3 rd party information from NVD and MITRE might have been used as input for compiling this knowledge base. See MITRE's Terms of Use for more information. Features \u00b6 Creation of vulnerability statements Retrieval and reconciliation of statement from multiple repositories, based on user-specified policies Requirements \u00b6 None, the kaybee binary is self-contained. Binary versions for Windows, Linux, MacOS are available for download . Limitations \u00b6 This project is work-in-progress. The vulnerability knowledge base only contains information about vulnerabilities in Java and Python open source components. Known Issues \u00b6 The list of current issues is available here . Feel free to open a new issue if you think you found a bug or if you have a feature request. How to obtain support \u00b6 For the time being, please use GitHub issues both to report bugs and to request help. Documentation and better support channels will come soon. Contributing \u00b6 Vulnerability data \u00b6 A structured process to create and share vulnerability data is work in progress. Until it is defined, we invite you to just create pull requests in order to submit new vulnerability data. Such pull requests should contain a vulnerability identifier, the URL of the source code repository of the affected component and one or more identifiers of the commits used to fix the vulnerability. Contributing code \u00b6 Pull requests are welcome. Please make sure you provide tests for your code, that you can successfully execute make check with no errors and that you include adequate documentation in your contribution. Other non-code contributions \u00b6 Non-code contributions such as documentation, bug reports, etc. are also most appreciated. License \u00b6 Copyright \u00a9 2020 SAP SE or an SAP affiliate company.
